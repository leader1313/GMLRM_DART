class ConstraintsGenerator:
    """Class handling creation and management of must-link and cannot-link
    constraints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index_groups : list of arrays with shape ( n_group_instances ), optional
        Each element of 'index_groups' is an array containing indices
        representing instances within a particular group. It's assumed that the
        complete dataset is arranged in a matrix -- call it X. The row number
        of a given entry in X is an element of one of the 'index_groups'. A
        'group' represents, e.g., a data cluster, a segmented region in an
        image, etc.

    cardinality_thresh : integer, optional
        The must-link and cannot-link constraints are contained in a graph.
        This threshold specifies the maximum cardinality that any connected
        subgraph is allowed to have.
        
    must_link_dist_thresh : float, optional
        Distance threshold for must-link constraints. This is an optional
        input, and is only meaningful if 'tuple_groups' is also specified.
        Specification of these two will limit the must-link constraints to
        those pairs that are within 'must_link_dist_thresh' (Euclidean
        distance) of one another.

    cannot_link_dist_thresh : float, optional
        Distance threshold for cannot-link constraints. This is an optional
        input, and is only meaningful if 'tuple_groups' is also specified.
        Specification of these two will limit the cannot-link constraints to
        those pairs that are within 'cannot_link_dist_thresh' (Euclidean
        distance) of one another.

    tuple_groups : list of arrays with shape (n_group_instances, dim), optional
        Tuple groups correspond to 'index_groups'. I.e. a given 'index_group'
        entry reprents a particular row number in the complete data matrix, X,
        and the corresponding 'tuple_group' represents the actual row entry.
        This is an optional entry, and is only meaningful if 'dist_thresh' is
        also specified. Specification of these two will limit the constraints
        to those pairs that are within a specified (Euclidean) distance of one
        another.

    constraints : networkx graph, optional
        The constraints are encoded in a networkx graph, in which each graph
        node is a tuple from one of the 'groups', and each edge represents a
        constraint. The edges have a string attribute called 'constraint',
        which is either set to 'must_link' or 'cannot_link'.

    num_cannot_links : integer
        Number of cannot-link constraints to generate. The constraints will be

    cardinality_thresh : integer, optional
        The must-link and cannot-link constraints are contained in a graph.
        This threshold specifies the maximum cardinality that any connected
        subgraph is allowed to have.

    tuple_groups : list of arrays with shape (n_group_instances, dim), optional
        Tuple groups correspond to 'index_groups'. I.e. a given 'index_group'
        entry reprents a particular row number in the complete data matrix, X,

        those pairs that are within 'must_link_max_dist' (Euclidean
        distance) of one another.

    cannot_link_max_dist : float, optional
        Max distance threshold for cannot-link constraints. This is an optional
        input, and is only meaningful if 'tuple_groups' is also specified.
        Specification of these two will limit the cannot-link constraints to
        those pairs that are within 'cannot_link_max_dist' (Euclidean

    must_link_min_dist : float, optional
        Min distance threshold for must-link constraints. This is an optional
        input, and is only meaningful if 'tuple_groups' is also specified.
        Specification of these two will limit the must-link constraints to
        those pairs that are at least 'must_link_min_dist' (Euclidean
        distance) apart.

    cannot_link_min_dist : float, optional
        Min distance threshold for cannot-link constraints. This is an optional
        input, and is only meaningful if 'tuple_groups' is also specified.
        Specification of these two will limit the cannot-link constraints to
        those pairs that are at least 'cannot_link_min_dist' (Euclidean

        Each element of 'index_groups' is an array containing indices
        representing instances within a particular group. It's assumed that the
        complete dataset is arranged in a matrix -- call it X. The row number
        of a given entry in X is an element of one of the 'index_groups'. A
        'group' represents, e.g., a data cluster, a segmented region in an
        image, etc.

    tuple_groups : list of arrays with shape (n_group_instances, dim), optional
        Tuple groups correspond to 'index_groups'. I.e. a given 'index_group'

        also specified. Specification of these two will limit the constraints
        to those pairs that are within a specified (Euclidean) distance of one
        another.

    min_dist_thresh : float, optional
        Min distance threshold. This is an optional input, and is only
        meaningful if 'tuple_groups' is also specified. Specification of these
        two will limit the constraints to those pairs that at least
        'min_dist_thresh' (Euclidean distance) apart.

        Max distance threshold. This is an optional input, and is only
        meaningful if 'tuple_groups' is also specified. Specification of these

    Parameters
    ----------
    kernel : list
        A list with two elements. The first element is a string indicating the
        type of kernel. The second element is an array indicating the parameter
        values of the kernel. The kernel is used to compute the Gram matrix,
        and the "augmented" Gram matrix (containing entries not only for inputs
        corresponding to observed data, but also for domain locations at which
        you want to predict target values) which is needed for regression.

    inputs : array, shape ( n_instances, input_dim ), optional
        Array of inputs (aka domain locations) of observed data

    targets : array, shape ( n_instances, target_dim ), optional
        Array of observed target values at corresponding 'input' locations

    gram_mat : array, shape ( n_instances, n_instances ), optional
        Gram matrix corresponding to observed input data. If the Gram matrix is
        not specified using this method, or if the currently stored Gram matrix
        does not have the expected shape, the Gram matrix will be computed
        using 'kernel'

    prob_mat : array, shape ( n_instances, n_instances ), optional
        Diagonal array. Each diagonal element indicates the probability that
        the corresponding target belongs to the Gaussian Process. For
        typical Gaussian Process regression, this matrix should simply be the
        identity matrix

    precision : double, optional
        The known noise precision on the target values
